# Title of Project: Bus Reservation System
#### Team Members: Manasi Deshmukh, Sayli Borole, Sakshi Dabhade, Aarya Dandapur


### Problem statement
Create a bus reservation system that allows passengers to reserve seats, cancel reservations,
be placed on a waiting list if all available seats are taken, and determine the total fare.
Data structures used:
Arrays: Arrays are used to store the bus details in this program. Since using arrays makes it
simpler to implement the delete, update, and search operations. Bus details like number and
name of stops, no. of seats and distance etc. are stored in the arrays.
Queue: We have implemented a queue using a linked list. It is used for adding passengers to
the waiting list if the seats are already booked. Because of its FIFO behavior and the
requirement that passengers on the waiting list be served in order of arrival, the queue has been
used to implement this feature.
Linked list: It has been used to store the details of passengers. Linked lists make it simpler to
keep all the information in a single node because there are numerous passenger details.

About program
There are 5 buses in this program scheduled for various places. Every bus has a specific
number of stops and seats. Each bus has 10 seats. A passenger can reserve multiple seats at
any of the stops mentioned in the bus route. The program enables the user to enter his/her
information. The passenger has to provide the departure and destination. If there are buses
available, then the passenger information is added; otherwise, the proper message is printed. In
order to add a passenger, the user has to provide the name and the number of seats to be
booked. Passengers are given a choice of seats. Also, he or she can cancel the reservation.
We have also added the feature of a waiting list to this program. This feature allows the
passenger to stay on the waiting list if the seats are full.
